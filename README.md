This repository contains an IPYNB file which contains code for doing Univariate and
Multivariate Analysis on the Student Performance dataset. The analysis has been performed by making various graphs
using predefined python libraries. After doing the analysis, the conclusions drawn have been put at the 
end of the file for the user to understand. The conclusions drawn allow the end user to understand the dataset
and make informed decisions related to the students which would impact their learning in a positive way.
